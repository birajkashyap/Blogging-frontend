        <p>
          I'm Biraj Kashyap, a passionate full-stack web developer with a deep
          interest in building robust and scalable web applications. With a
          focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I
          have honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development,
          allowing me to create seamless and user-friendly experiences. In
          addition to mastering the MERN stack, I am well-versed in
          containerization technologies such as Docker and container
          orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Leveraging these technologies, I
          have optimized deployment processes and ensured the scalability and
          reliability of web applications. My journey in web development is
          driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to stay updated with the
          latest trends and best practices in the industry. I thrive in
          collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills and learn
          from others, continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible in
          web development.
